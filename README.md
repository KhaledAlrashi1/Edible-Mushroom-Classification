# Mushroom Classification Project
## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying mushrooms into edible and poisonous categories. Using a dataset containing 61,069 instances of 173 mushroom species, the goal is to analyze 15 different features (such as cap shape and stem height) to build accurate classification models. We employ various machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and Multi-Layer Perceptron, to achieve this.
